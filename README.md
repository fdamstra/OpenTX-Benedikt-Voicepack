# Benedikt Voicepack for Taranis

## Description
Tired of the computerized voice on your Taranis? Want something different? This is the
voicepack for you. From the moment you hear, "Hello, my friends, and welcome to OpenTX",
you'll know you're in for something special. This is not yet another computer generated
voicepack. This isn't another sultry seductive woman's voice. This is Benedikt. He's a 
chief scientist or something. I dunno. I suspect he's important in the scene. Maybe?

I'm pretty sure he either owns or works at Micro Motor Warehouse. So if you like this, 
maybe support him.

Here's a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ydzWfaL7k&t=1m14s) demonstrating
some of the tracks.

## Instructions
### Easy Method:
Download the zip file: [Benedikt_Voicepack_latest.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdamstra/OpenTX-Benedikt-Voicepack/master/Benedikt_Voicepack_latest.zip)
Extract to your Taranis voice card into SOUNDS/en/ (Helpful hint: You may want to backup this directory first,
as this will overwrite the files from the default english voicepack)

### For the latest and greatest:
Copy the files from the ["Benedikt Taranis Voicepack" folder (`SOUNDS/en`)](https://github.com/fdamstra/OpenTX-Benedikt-Voicepack/tree/master/Benedikt%20Taranis%20Voicepack)
onto your SD card, overwriting files existing files. (Helpful hint: If you've made changes, you may want to back up 
first!).

## Credits
This is *not* my idea. I just got into RC stuff in late 2016. The original "v1.0.1" voicepack
dates back to around October 15 of that year. When I got my Taranis and was looking for 
voicepacks, there were a few out there, and they were all kind of blah. This one stood out. 
And I knew it was a keeper when I turned on my Taranis and my wife said, "You are so weird."

So, here's some info on where it started.

Announcement from Benedikt is here: https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/hello-my-friends-welcome-to-opentx-benedikts-voice-for-opentx/111
But real source seems to be this reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/3os5je/introducing_the_mia_taranis_voicepack_227_tracks/
The idea seems to have come from 'johnslims', and 'lazd' did the work.

Regardless, a big "Thank you!" to all the people who did the work before me, and to Benedikt
himself for having an awesome voice and accent for us to put on our radios. 

The thread discussing an updated voicepack is here: https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/is-there-an-updated-benedikt-voice-pack-for-taranis/2693. 
And lastly, there is a "behind the scenes" YouTube video of Benedikt recording the new sound
files here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-aNwZORNYA

## The Problem
This voicepack was originally made for OpenTX 1.x. The OpenTX developers changed the standard 
filenames in OpenTX 2.1, though the voicepack still mostly worked. And then 2.2 came out with 
even more changes. And while it still mostly worked, I thought it would be really nice if it
was complete.

Lazd gave me permission to upgrade his work, and Benedikt was kind enough to record the missing 
sounds. Again, THANKS!

## Current Status
I believe all sounds were recorded. They've been trimmed and normalized, and I've put them on 
own X9D+ for testing.

I need beta (alpha?) testers. Please feel free to 
[create issues on github](https://github.com/fdamstra/OpenTX-Benedikt-Voicepack/issues)
if you find issues. Please be as specific as possible. I'm not a sound guy nor an OpenTX
dev. I'm just an RC hobbyist like yourself, so be kind.
