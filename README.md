# Benedikt Voicepack for Taranis

## Description
Tired of the computerized voice on your Taranis? Want something different? This is the
voicepack for you. From the moment you hear, "Hello, my friends, and welcome to OpenTX",
you'll know you're in for something special. This is not yet another computer generated
voicepack. This isn't another sultry seductive woman's voice. This is Benedikt. He's a 
chief scientist or something. I dunno. I suspect he's important. Maybe? Really, I don't
know him from Adam.

## Credits
This is *not* my idea. I just got into RC stuff in late 2016. The original "v1.0.1" voicepack
dates back to around October 15. When I got my Taranis and was looking for voicepacks,
there were a few out there, and they were all kind of blah. This one stood out. And I knew 
it was a keeper when I turned on my Taranis and my wife said, "You are so weird."

So, here's some info on where it started.

Announcement from Benedikt is here: https://community.micro-motor-warehouse.com/t/hello-my-friends-welcome-to-opentx-benedikts-voice-for-opentx/111
But real source seems to be this reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/3os5je/introducing_the_mia_taranis_voicepack_227_tracks/
The idea seems to have come from 'johnslims', and 'lazd' did the work.

## The Problem
This voicepack was made for OpenTX 1.x. They changed the filenames in OpenTX 2.1, though it 
mostly works. And 2.2 is about to come out with some more changes. It still mostly works, 
but it would be really nice if it was complete. So I'm hoping to update it and fill in the 
gaps.

I've reached out to lazd for permission and Benedikt to ask him to record a few more. Hopefully
both come through. In the meantime, I've started tracking progress.

In other words, this is *INCOMPLETE*. This voicepack is not really ready for your Taranis. However,
if you're okay with a few glitches, it's good enough.

## Current Status
I've renamed files from the original pack to the new naming convention. I'm going to start working 
on "scripts" for Benedikt (or failing that, a Benedikt impersonator) to complete the set. 

I'd also like to add some sounds. I feel like we're missing some phrases that might be helpful. If
there is a sound in particular you need, please post an issue ASAP.

### Instructions
If you start with the official SD image, and copy the "Benedikt Taranis Voicepack",
overwriting files when possible, you'll get most everything. You'll find some strange behavior, 
but it will almost all work.

### Tracking
The table below is tracking current status. A "Y" under "exists" means the file was there without
needing to be renamed. If a different string is there, it means the file had to be renamed.
